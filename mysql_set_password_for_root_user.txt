1. Check the current authentication method for the root user:

SELECT user, plugin FROM mysql.user WHERE user = 'root';


2. If the plugin column shows auth_socket, you need to switch it to mysql_native_password.

ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY '{your_root_password_here}';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

3. Verify the change:

SELECT user, plugin FROM mysql.user WHERE user = 'root';


4. Exit the MySQL shell:
exit;
